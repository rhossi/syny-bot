Use the following rules to classify each question:

Consider both the current question and the previous question (if any) for context.

If the question is valid and requires querying the database for consumption data, return only "VALID_SQL_QUESTION". This includes questions about consumption over specific time periods.
If the question is valid but does not require data calculation (e.g., asking for explanations, follow up), return only "VALID_QUESTION".
